        <li>Soy Sauce 2tbsp</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar 2tbsp</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken: In a bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Add the chicken thighs (2 lbs), ensuring they are well coated with the marinade. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the marinated chicken thighs to the pan, making sure to spread them out in a single layer. Cook for about 6-8 minutes on each side or until the chicken is cooked through and golden brown on the outside.</li>
        <li>Glaze with Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the remaining marinade with an additional 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly into a glaze consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a serving plate. Pour the prepared sauce over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well coated. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the chicken for an extra crunch and garnish with sliced green onions if desired. Serve hot with rice or your favorite side dish, and enjoy your homemade sesame chicken!</li>
